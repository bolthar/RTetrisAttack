A tetris attack clone

Pre-alpha, not a working game yet.

= Dependencies:
- ruby1.9
- dev packages for sdl image and mixer
- rubysdl (sudo gem install rubysdl, install the dev packages before installing the gem)

when all dependencies are resolved, ruby1.9 main.rb (in /lib) runs the game.

Arrow keys to move around
N to swap blocks
Q to quit the game

enjoy!
